## Introduction

ERC-6900 Plugins is an open-source project that provides a set of modular plugins for blockchain applications built on top of the ERC-6900 standard. These plugins enhance the functionality of smart contracts and enable developers to create more complex and feature-rich dApps.

## Project Overview

The ERC-6900 Plugins project consists of several interrelated components:

- **Plugins**: Modular smart contracts that can be installed on top of existing blockchain applications.
- **Core Contracts**: Base contracts that define the structure and behavior of the plugins.
- **Interfaces**: Standardized interfaces for communication between plugins and core contracts.
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test suites for ensuring the reliability and security of the plugins.
